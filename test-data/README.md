## How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Application
1. Make sure the dev server is running
2. Open the application in your browser

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click on the "Internal System Export" upload area
2. Select the `internal-system.csv` file
3. Click on the "Provider Statement" upload area  
4. Select the `provider-statement.csv` file

### Step 3: Run Reconciliation
1. Click the "Run Reconciliation" button
2. Wait for processing to complete

### Step 4: Verify Results
Check that the summary shows:
- **Match Rate**: ~67% (4 perfect matches out of 6 total matches from 8 internal transactions)
- **Matched Transactions**: 6 (4 perfect + 2 with mismatches)
- **Internal Only**: 3
- **Provider Only**: 2

### Step 5: Test Features
1. **Search**: Try searching for "TXN002" in the matched transactions table
2. **Export**: Click export buttons to download CSV files
3. **Pagination**: If you add more test data, verify pagination works
4. **Mismatch Highlighting**: Check that TXN002 and TXN007 show mismatches clearly

### Step 6: Test Edge Cases
1. **Empty Files**: Try uploading empty CSV files
2. **Invalid Format**: Try uploading a .txt file
3. **Missing Columns**: Create a CSV without transaction_reference column
4. **Large Files**: Create files with 100+ transactions

## Creating Additional Test Data

To create more comprehensive test data:

```csv
# For testing large datasets
transaction_reference,amount,status,date,description
TXN001,100.00,completed,2024-01-01,Test transaction 1
TXN002,200.00,pending,2024-01-02,Test transaction 2
# ... add more rows
```

## Expected Performance
- File upload should be instant for small files
- Processing should complete within 1-2 seconds
- UI should remain responsive during processing
- Export should generate downloadable CSV files
